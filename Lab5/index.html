          <h3>New Study Finds Americans Scoot Over At Least 10 Miles Per Year</h3>
          <img src="images/scoot.jpg" alt="People scooting over on a bench" />

          <p>
            WASHINGTON, DC. A new report from the Department of Transportation
            claims the average American travels about 10 miles per year doing one
            simple thing: scooting over to make room for someone else.
          </p>

          <p>
            Researchers tracked movement on benches, bleachers, couches, and
            backseats and found that small slides, scooches, and awkward shuffles
            add up fast when you repeat them every day.
          </p>

          <p>
            The study also noted that people often scoot over, realize there was
            already enough space, and then scoot back, doubling the distance for
            no reason except social panic.

          <h3>Black Guy Asks Nation For Change</h3>
          <img src="images/obama.jpg" alt="Man speaking to a crowd" />

          <p>
            CHICAGO. Witnesses say a loud man approached a crowd of thousands in
            downtown Chicago and repeatedly demanded change from everyone who
            would listen.
          </p>

          <p>
            “The time for change is now,” the man shouted, speaking for nearly
            twenty minutes straight while urging strangers to finally deliver the
            change he needed.
          </p>

          <p>
            He told the crowd the need for change was urgent and insisted that
            only the people standing there could make change happen, right now,
            in this very moment.
          </p>

          <p>
            One local salesman said he had already heard the same speech multiple
            times that day and could not understand why the man was so obsessed
            with change or what he planned to do with it.
          </p>

          <p>
            After his opening lines, the man shifted topics constantly, jumping
            from affordable health care to foreign policy to jobs, then circling
            back to his original request for change like it was the only thing
            that mattered.
          </p>

          <p>
            Reports say the man has traveled from city to city doing the same
            routine, sometimes hugging strangers, sometimes pointing at random
            people and begging for help, and sometimes getting angry when he did
            not get the change he wanted.
          </p>

          <p>
            Most bystanders ignored him, though a few admitted they felt slightly
            guilty, like they should help, even if they had no idea what kind of
            change he actually meant.
          </p>

          <p>
            A local gun shop owner said he works hard, pays taxes, and does not
            appreciate being approached by a stranger demanding change, adding
            that what the man really needs is a job.

          <h3>Wealthy Teen Nearly Experiences Consequence</h3>
          <img src="images/wealthy-teen.jpg" alt="Teen near a car" />

          <p>
            SOMERSET, NJ. Authorities described a “near tragedy” this weekend
            after a wealthy teenager came dangerously close to facing a real
            consequence for something he did.
          </p>

          <p>
            Police reports say the teen drank at a party, ignored friends who
            told him not to drive, and then got behind the wheel anyway because
            he felt completely untouchable.
          </p>

          <p>
            While driving home, he drifted into other lanes and slammed into a
            minivan carrying a family, briefly putting him face to face with the
            kind of moment that usually teaches people a lesson.
          </p>

          <p>
            That lesson did not arrive, however, because the teen’s airbags
            deployed and his family’s lawyers allegedly arrived so fast that they
            might have been riding in the trunk.
          </p>

          <p>
            The police chief stated the teen showed no remorse, claimed he did
            nothing wrong, and somehow avoided any serious punishment despite
            clearly being responsible.
          </p>

          <p>
            One officer said the teen spent most of the night repeating, “Do you
            know who I am,” as if his last name alone should override traffic
            laws.
          </p>

          <p>
            The teen’s father told reporters his son is “strong” for refusing to
            accept blame, adding that admitting fault would have been “a sign of
            weakness.”
          </p>

          <p>
            A family friend who works in the legal system called the situation a
            miracle, explaining that the teen survived the crash with no injuries,
            no responsibility, and the exact same personality.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the days after the crash, the teen was reportedly almost assigned
            community service, but the punishment was reduced after testimony
            focused on how emotionally difficult it was for him to be mildly
            inconvenienced.
          </p>

          <p>
            During the process, the teen was forced to pause a video game for a
            few seconds to sign paperwork, an event his family later described
            as “traumatizing.”
          </p>

          <p>
            The teen later said it was terrifying to briefly imagine a world
            where actions have outcomes, admitting he almost learned something.
          </p>

          <p>
            At press time, the teen was relaxing comfortably at home while the
            victims remained hospitalized, and sources confirmed he was already
            back to living like nothing happened.

            Nike Recalls Sweat Wicking Shirts That Pulled Gallons Of Liquid

          <p>
            BEAVERTON, OR. Nike issued a recall after customers reported a new
            training shirt that removed moisture so aggressively it seemed to
            remove everything else too.
          </p>

          <p>
            The company warned that some wearers experienced extreme dehydration
            within minutes, and one customer reportedly described the sensation
            as being turned into a dry sponge while still standing upright.

            Tom Hanks Recalls Arriving On A Beautiful Day In The Neighborhood Set
            At Dawn For Grueling 6 Hour Cardigan Application Process

          <img src="images/tomhanks.jpg" alt="Tom Hanks" />

          <p>
            LOS ANGELES. Tom Hanks said making the film required patience, mainly
            because he had to arrive before sunrise so a full team could spend
            hours putting a cardigan on him with extreme care.
          </p>

          <p>
            Hanks explained that the sweater process was so intense it made the
            rest of acting feel easy, and he was reportedly furious when he later
            learned the studio considered replacing the cardigan with a digital
            version.
